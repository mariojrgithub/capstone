I collected data from a github repo named the "baseballdatabank". This data is provided by the Chadwich Baseball Bureau and based in part on the Lahman Baseball Database. Other data was collect from the Retrosheet. After downloading this data, I fed various csv's into pandas and did simple eda. I checked the head(), the shape, statistical analysis and datatypes. I also checked for null values as well as correlation. Finally I ran Pandas Profiling to get a global view of my data. From here I plan on understanding the columns better as well as seeing where the various tables match up. I will also be doing other exploratory plots such as histograms to examine the distribution of numerical values.

I would like to build a model looking at pitching and hitting data over time in order to predict the outcome of an at-bat. I plan on using newly learned time-series techniques on this data in order to properly prepared for prediction. 

My assumptions at this point is that the data is accurate and there are enough data points and columns that may be important to my final results.

Risks include not fully understanding the data provided or overestimating the quality of that data.
